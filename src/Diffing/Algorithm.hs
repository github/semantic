  --   This is very like 'traverse', with two key differences:
  --
  --   1. The traversal distributes through an 'Alternative' functor, not just an 'Applicative'.
  --   2. The traversal is mediated by two different functions, one for positions which should be ignored for substructural diffing, the other for positions which should be diffed substructurally.
  --
  --   These two functions allow us to say e.g. that comparisons against 'Data.Syntax.Context' should also be made against its subject, but not against any of the comments, resulting in the insertion of both comments and context when documenting an existing function.
  --
  --   By default, 'subalgorithmFor' produces 'empty', rejecting substructural comparisons. This is important for performance, as alternations with 'empty' are eliminated at construction time.
