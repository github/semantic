-- | An r-algebra producing 'Just' a 'Declaration' for syntax nodes corresponding to high-level declarations, or 'Nothing' otherwise.
--
--   Customizing this for a given syntax type involves two steps:
--
--   1. Defining a 'CustomHasDeclaration' instance for the type.
--   2. Adding the type to the 'DeclarationStrategy' type family.
--
--   If you’re getting errors about missing a 'CustomHasDeclaration' instance for your syntax type, you probably forgot step 1.
--
--   If you’re getting 'Nothing' for your syntax node at runtime, you probably forgot step 2.
