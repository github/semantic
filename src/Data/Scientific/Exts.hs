-- | This is a very flexible and forgiving parser for Scientific values.
-- Unlike 'scientificP' or Scientific's 'Read' instance, this handles the myriad
-- array of floating-point syntaxes across languages:
-- * omitted whole parts, e.g. @.5@
-- * omitted decimal parts, e.g. @5.@
-- * numbers with trailing imaginary/length specifiers, @1.7j, 20L@
-- * numeric parts, in whole or decimal or exponent parts, with @_@ characters
-- * hexadecimal, octal, and binary literals (TypeScript needs this because all numbers are floats)
-- You may either omit the whole or the leading part, not both; this parser also rejects the empty string.
-- It does /not/ handle hexadecimal floating-point numbers yet, as no language we parse supports them.
-- This will need to be changed when we support Java.
-- Please note there are extant parser bugs where complex literals (e.g. @123j@) are parsed
-- as floating-point rather than complex quantities. This parser discards all suffixes.
-- This parser is unit-tested in Data.Scientific.Spec.
