-- | An F-algebra on some 'Recursive' type @t@.
--
--   An F-algebra is an evaluator for a functor (@f@) populated with the results (@a@s) of evaluating each child of the functor to a result (@a@), applied at each node starting from the leaves and working towards the root. @a@ is called the carrier type of the algebra because it carries the (results of the) functions used to compute the functorâ€™s structure and enforce the laws of that algebra.
type FAlgebra f a = f a -> a

-- | An R-algebra on some 'Recursive' type @t@.
--
--   An R-algebra is an evaluator for a functor (@f@) populated with pairs of the children (@t@) and the results (@a@s) of evaluating each child of the functor to a result (@a@), applied at each node starting from the leaves and working towards the root.

type RAlgebra f t a = f (t, a) -> a

-- | Like an R-algebra, but using 'Subterm' to label the fields instead of an anonymous pair.
type SubtermAlgebra f t a = f (Subterm t a) -> a


-- | Fold a 'Recursive' structure using a 'SubtermAlgebra'. Like 'para', but with named fields for subterms and values.
