-- | Assignment of AST onto some other structure (typically terms).
--
--   Parsing yields an AST represented as a Rose tree labelled with symbols in the language’s grammar and source locations (byte Range and Span). An Assignment represents a (partial) map from AST nodes onto some other structure; in essence, it’s a parser that operates over trees. (For our purposes, this structure is typically Terms annotated with source locations.) Assignments are able to match based on symbol, sequence, and hierarchy; thus, in @x = y@, both @x@ and @y@ might have the same symbol, @Identifier@, the left can be assigned to a variable declaration, while the right can be assigned to a variable reference.
--
--   Assignments can be any of the following primitive rules:
--
--   1. 'symbol' rules match a node against a specific symbol in the source language’s grammar; they succeed iff a) there is a current node, and b) its symbol is equal to the argument symbol. Matching a 'symbol' rule does not advance past the current node, meaning that you can match a node against a symbol and also e.g. match against the node’s 'children'. This also means that some care must be taken, as repeating a symbol with 'many' or 'some' (see below) will never advance past the current node and could therefore loop forever.
--
--   2. 'location' rules always succeed, and produce the current node’s Location (byte Range and Span). If there is no current node (i.e. if matching has advanced past the root node or past the last child node when operating within a 'children' rule), the location is instead the end of the most recently matched node, specified as a zero-width Range and Span. 'location' rules do not advance past the current node, meaning that you can both match a node’s 'location' and other properties.
--
--   3. 'source' rules succeed whenever there is a current node (i.e. matching has not advanced past the root node or the last child node when operating within a 'children' rule), and produce its source as a ByteString. 'source' is intended to match leaf nodes such as e.g. comments. 'source' rules advance past the current node.
--
--   4. 'children' rules apply their argument (an assignment) to the children of the current node, succeeding iff a) there is a current node, b) the argument assignment matches the children, and c) there are no (regular) nodes left over (see below re: tokens), producing the result of matching the argument assignment against the children. 'children' rules can match a node with no child nodes if their argument can successfully match at the end of input.
--
--   5. Via the 'Alternative' instance, 'empty' assignments always fail. This can be used (in combination with the 'Monad' instance) to (for example) fail if a 'source' assignment produces an ill-formatted ByteString. However, see below re: committed choice.
--
--   6. Via the 'Applicative' instance, 'pure' (or via the 'Monad' instance, 'pure') assignments always succeed, producing the passed value. They do not advance past the current node. In combination with the 'Alternative' instance, 'pure' can provide default values when optional syntax is not present in the AST.
--
--   Assignments can further be combined in a few different ways:
--
--   1. The 'Functor' instance maps values from the AST (Location, ByteString, etc.) into another structure.
--
--   2. The 'Applicative' instance assigns sequences of (sibling) AST nodes in order, as well as providing 'pure' assignments (see above). Most assignments of a single piece of syntax consist of an 'Applicative' chain of assignments.
--
--   3. The 'Alternative' instance chooses between a set of assignments, as well as providing 'empty' assignments (see above). See below re: committed choice for best practices for efficiency & error reporting when it comes to assigning multiple alternatives. Most high-level assignments (e.g. “declaration” or “statement” assignments) consist of choices among two or more 'Applicative' chains of assignments, mirroring the structure of the parser’s choices. The 'Alternative' instance also enables repetitions via the 'many' (≥ 0 repetitions) and 'some' (≥ 1 repetition) methods. Finally, the 'optional' function uses the 'Alternative' instance to assign a value in 'Maybe', succeeding with 'Nothing' when unmatched.
--
--   4. The 'Monad' instance allows assignments to depend on the results of earlier assignments. In general, most assignments should not be written using the 'Monad' instance; however, some specific situations require it, e.g. assigning 'x += y' to be equivalent to 'x = x + y'.
--
--
--   == Best practices
--
--   Because of their flexibility, the same assignment can often be written in multiple different ways. The following best practices should ensure efficient assignment with clear error messages for ill-formed AST.
--
--   === Committed choice
--
--   Assignments can represent alternatives as either committed or uncommitted choices, both written with '<|>'. “Committed” in this context means that a failure in one of the alternatives will not result in backtracking followed by an attempt of one of the other alternatives; thus, committed choice is more efficient. (By the same token, it enables much better error messages since backtracking erases most of the relevant context.) Committed choices are constructed via the following rules:
--
--   1. 'empty' is dropped from choices.
--
--   2. 'symbol' rules construct a committed choice (with only a single alternative).
--
--   3. 'fmap' (and by extension '<$>' and '<$') of a committed choice is a committed choice.
--
--   4. '<*>' (and by extension '*>' and '<*') with a committed choice on the left is a committed choice.
--
--   5. '>>=' (and by extension '>>', '=<<', and '<<') of a committed choice is a committed choice. It may be helpful to think of this and the above rule for '<*>' as “sequences starting with committed choices remain committed choices.”
--
--   6. '<|>' of two committed choices is a committed choice.
--
--   Finally, if a given choice is not a committed choice, it is an uncommitted choice.
--
--   Distilling the above, the rule of thumb is to always start an assignment for a given piece of syntax with either a 'symbol' rule or an 'fmap' over a 'symbol' rule. When assigning multiple pieces of syntax, place any known uncommitted choices at the (rightmost) end of the chain; '<|>' is left-associative, so this guarantees that you’re adding at most one uncommitted choice on top of the ones already present.
--
--   === Matching tokens
--
--   AST symbols are classified by their 'symbolType' as either 'Regular', 'Anonymous', or 'Auxiliary'. 'Auxiliary' never appears in ASTs; 'Regular' is for the symbols of explicitly named productions in the grammar, and 'Anonymous' is for unnamed productions of content such as tokens. Most of the time, assignments are only concerned with the named productions, and thus will be using 'Regular' symbols. Therefore, when matching a committed choice of all-'Regular' symbols, nodes with 'Anonymous' symbols will be skipped. However, in some cases grammars don’t provide a named symbol for e.g. every kind of infix operator, and thus the only way to differentiate between them is by means of a 'symbol' rule for an 'Anonymous' token. In these cases, and before every other kind of assignment, the 'Anonymous' nodes will not be skipped so that matching can succeed.
--
--   Therefore, in addition to the rule of thumb for committed choices (see above), try to match 'Regular' symbols up front, and only match 'Anonymous' ones in the middle of a chain. That will ensure that you don’t have to make redundant effort to explicitly skip 'Anonymous' nodes ahead of multiple alternatives, and can instead rely on them being automatically skipped except when explicitly required.
