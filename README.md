# Semantic

`semantic` is a Haskell library and command line tool for parsing, analyzing, and comparing source code.

In a hurry? Check out our documentation of [example uses for the `semantic` command line tool](docs/examples.md).

## Usage

Run `semantic --help` for complete list of up-to-date options.

#### Parse
```
Usage: semantic parse [--sexpression | (--json-symbols|--symbols) |
                        --proto-symbols | --show | --quiet] [FILES...]
  Generate parse trees for path(s)

Available options:
  --sexpression            Output s-expression parse trees (default)
  --json-symbols,--symbols Output JSON symbol list
  --proto-symbols          Output protobufs symbol list
  --show                   Output using the Show instance (debug only, format
                           subject to change without notice)
  --quiet                  Don't produce output, but show timing stats
  -h,--help                Show this help text
   ```

## Development

`semantic` requires at least GHC 8.10.1 and Cabal 3.0. We strongly recommend using [`ghcup`][ghcup] to sandbox GHC versions, as GHC packages installed through your OS's package manager may not install statically-linked versions of the GHC boot libraries. `semantic` currently builds only on Unix systems; users of other operating systems may wish to use the [Docker images](https://github.com/github/semantic/packages/11609).

We use `cabal's` [Nix-style local builds][nix] for development. To get started quickly:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:github/semantic.git
cd semantic
script/bootstrap
cabal v2-build all
cabal v2-run semantic:test
cabal v2-run semantic:semantic -- --help
```

You can also use the [Bazel](https://bazel.build) build system for development. To learn more about Bazel and why it might give you a better development experience, check the [build documentation](docs/build.md).

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:github/semantic.git
cd semantic
script/bootstrap-bazel
bazel build //...
```


 `stack` as a build tool is not officially supported; there is [unofficial `stack.yaml` support](https://github.com/jkachmar/semantic-stack-yaml) available, though we cannot make guarantees as to its stability.

## Technology and architecture

Architecturally, `semantic`:
1. Generates per-language Haskell syntax types based on [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) grammar definitions.
2. Reads blobs from a filesystem or provided via a protocol buffer request.
3. Returns blobs or performs analysis.
4. Renders output in one of many supported formats.

Throughout its lifestyle, `semantic` has leveraged a number of interesting algorithms and techniques, including:

- Myers' algorithm (SES) as described in the paper [*An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations*][SES]
- RWS as described in the paper [*RWS-Diff: Flexible and Efficient Change Detection in Hierarchical Data*][RWS].
- Open unions and [data types à la carte](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~W.Swierstra/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf).
- An implementation of [Abstracting Definitional Interpreters][adi] extended to work with an à la carte representation of syntax terms.
