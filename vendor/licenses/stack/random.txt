This library (libraries/base) is derived from code from two
sources: 

  * Code from the GHC project which is largely (c) The University of
    Glasgow, and distributable under a BSD-style license (see below),

  * Code from the Haskell 98 Report which is (c) Simon Peyton Jones
    and freely redistributable (but see the full license for
    restrictions).

The full text of these licenses is reproduced below.  Both of the
licenses are BSD-style or compatible.
